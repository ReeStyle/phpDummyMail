# Usage

Prerequisites:
- PHP5.6+ - It is PHP5.6 and PHP7 compatible: We use the Class::class which is only present in 
versions from PHP5.6 on
- Composer
- \[path_to_phpdummymail]/mails/ and \[path_to_phpdummymail]/logs/ folders should be writable 
for the web service (www-data on debian)  


Installation is simple:
- Unpack (or clone with git) into a folder 
- Run 'composer install' (DO NOT run 'composer update'!)
- Edit your php.ini (both CGI and CLI!) and edit the following line:
    - sendmail_path = \[path_to_phpdummymail]/receiver.php
- Restart web service if necessary (e.g. apache fpm need to)
- Run: php tester.php
- Create an alias to the \[path_to_phpdummymail]/htdocs/ in your 
apache config (or whatever flavor webservice you're using)
and set index.php as primary file to invoke
- Edit htdocs/config/config.php and replace '/phpdummymail' with the alias you used. You 
may alter the other configuration items at your own risk. 
  
Usage:
- Within your browser go to the alias you just created
- It should already work 
- Hit the refresh button to update mails

Done, it should already be running
